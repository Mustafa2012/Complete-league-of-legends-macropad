## August 5th: Finished the schematic!

I completed the schematic for my macropad! I originally planned to use the esp32c3 but then I changed my mind and used the seeduiono rp2040 instead. I also had a bit trouble finding the footprints of some components but eventually, it all worked out.

## August 5th: Partialy designed the pcb!

I did some arranging of the components onto the pcb.My rp2040 footprint was also wrong as I had accidently used the surface mounted one I also found out that my previous schematic had some flaws and also fixed that!

## August 6th: Completed the pcb!

I completed the layout and routing for my pcb! It took a long time to layout the keys. I specifically designed the macropad to play League of Legends so I layout the keys in that format.

**Total time spent:2.5hr**

## August 7th: Completed the first layer of the case top!

I started by exporting the 3d model of the pcb to onshape. Then I went to the keyboard layout editor but bacause I have a custom layout, it could not be designed there. So, I had to make it by hand. I measured the pcb and made the top plate 2mm bigger from all sides. Then I encoutered a big problem, the model I imported to onshape of the pcb was soo much bigger than the original size. I spent so much time exporting different models and stuff but nothing worked. In the end I had to scale it down manually. Then I crafted the first layer completely by myself which took a lot of time!
