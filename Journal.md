## August 5th: Finished the schematic!

I completed the schematic for my macropad! I originally planned to use the esp32c3 but then I changed my mind and used the seeduiono rp2040 instead. I also had a bit trouble finding the footprints of some components but eventually, it all worked out.

## August 5th: Partialy designed the pcb!

I did some arranging of the components onto the pcb.My rp2040 footprint was also wrong as I had accidently used the surface mounted one I also found out that my previous schematic had some flaws and also fixed that!

## August 6th: Completed the pcb!

I completed the layout and routing for my pcb! It took a long time to layout the keys. I specifically designed the macropad to play League of Legends so I layout the keys in that format.
